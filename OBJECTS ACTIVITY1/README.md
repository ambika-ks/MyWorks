# 🏗️ Log Customer's Drink Order Using an Object

Implement the following user story:

* As a coffee shop owner, I want to store data about my customer's drink order in an object and log a message indicating whether the drink is ready or still in the queue.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the `customerOrder` object has three properties that store the drink's name, the number of sugars, and a Boolean indicating whether the order is ready.

* It's done when the drink name and the number of sugars is logged to the console.

* It's done when, if the order is ready, the message `"Ready for pick-up"` logs.

* It's done when, if the order is not ready, the message `"Still in order queue"` logs.
